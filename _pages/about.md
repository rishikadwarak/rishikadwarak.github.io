Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rishika, a data scientist on a mission to drive positive change in society through innovative projects aimed at tackling real-world challenges.

I am a graduate from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/programs/btech-in-computer-science-engineering/) with a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering and a minor in Economics. Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer with the Data Engineering & Analytics team under the HPE Compute Software & Firmware Engineering Division at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/in/en/compute.html?jumpid=ps_n1q8y6im2_aid-520074550&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw4vKpBhCZARIsAOKHoWR-Aj5JEfEv-b70lxhEsGR4qCwlWc85-gBV2Dz246g4q2WppgJ-nvoaAntxEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!13472!3!657075069960!e!!g!!hpe%20compute!19913506792!148246418066&).

My research interests lie in the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Human Computer Interaction** (HCI) to build intelligent interactive systems that can communicate with humans effectively and enable individuals to achieve their goals. My current research explores tools for the automation of qualitative study methodologies to aid researchers in conducting and analyzing longitudinal data studies in an efficient and ethical manner.

I am always open to collaboration on new projects. If you would like to discuss my current research or explore potential research avenues, please feel free to reach out to me!
