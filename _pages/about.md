Hello! 👋 I'm Rishika, a graduate from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/programs/btech-in-computer-science-engineering/) with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering and a minor in Economics. Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/in/en/compute.html?jumpid=ps_n1q8y6im2_aid-520074550&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw4vKpBhCZARIsAOKHoWR-Aj5JEfEv-b70lxhEsGR4qCwlWc85-gBV2Dz246g4q2WppgJ-nvoaAntxEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!13472!3!657075069960!e!!g!!hpe%20compute!19913506792!148246418066&).

My research interests lie in the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Human-Computer Interaction** (HCI) to build intelligent interactive systems that can communicate with humans effectively and enable individuals to conduct and analyze digital longitudinal data studies in an efficient and ethical way. 

My current research explores tools for the automation of qualitative study methodologies to aid researchers in conducting more efficient and accessible participatory data studies.

I am always open to collaboration on new projects. If you would like to discuss my current research or explore potential research avenues, please feel free to reach out to me!
